%function MI_OnlineClassification_Scaffolding2(recordingFolder)
%% MI Online Scaffolding
% This code creates an online EEG buffer which utilizes the model trained
% offline, and corresponding conditions, to classify between the possible labels.
% Assuming:
% 1. EEG is recorded using openBCI and streamed through LSL.
% 2. MI classifier has been previously trained.
% 3. A different machine/client is reading the LSL oulet stream in this
% code for the these commands.
% 4. Target labels are [-1 0 1] (left idle right)

% Remains to be done:
% 1. Add a "voting machine" which takes the classification and counts how
% many consecutive answers in the same direction / target to get a high(er)
% accuracy rate, even though it slows down the process by a large factor.
% 2. Add an online learn-with-feedback mechanism where there is a cue to
% one side (or idle) with a confidence bar showing the classification being
% made.
