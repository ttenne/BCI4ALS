%function MI_Online_Learning(recordingFolder)
%% MI Online Scaffolding
% This code creates an online EEG buffer which utilizes the model trained
% offline, and corresponding conditions, to classify between the possible labels.
% Furthermore, this code adds an "online learning" phase in which the
% subject is shown a specific label which she/he should imagine. After a
% defined amount of labeled trials, the classifier is updated.

% Assuming: 
% 1. EEG is recorded using openBCI and streamed through LSL.
% 2. A preliminary MI classifier has been trained.
% 3. A different machine/client is reading this LSL oulet stream for the commands sent through this code
% 4. Target labels are [-1 0 1] (left idle right)

% Remaining to be done:
% 1. Add a "voting machine" which takes the classification and counts how
% many consecutive answers in the same direction / target to get a high(er)
% accuracy rate, even though it slows down the process by a large factor.
% 2. Add an online learn-with-feedback mechanism where there is a visual feedback to
% one side (or idle) with a confidence bar showing the classification being made.
% 3. Advanced = add an online reinforcement code that updates the
% classifier with the wrong & right class classifications.
% 4. Add a serial classifier which predicts attention levels and updates
% the classifier only if "focus" is above a certain threshold.
